            "80g croissant, chopped",
            "240ml cognac",
            "50g Nutella",

            "200ml hot coffee",
            "200g double cream to serve",
            "Toasted coconut flakes to serve"

        method: [
            "Put the croissant and cognac in a blender or food processor and whizz until smooth. Transfer to a freezable container, cover and freeze for at least 2 hours. Strain through a very fine sieve (or for an even clearer finish, through coffee filter paper) and reserve.",
            "Put the Nutella, sugar and 25ml water in a small saucepan and gently warm until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool.",
            "To make the cocktail, measure out 50ml croissant cognac and 25ml Nutella syrup in each glass, then top up with 50ml hot coffee in each, stirring to combine. Put a spoon over the top of the coffee and gently pour double cream onto it (it should float on the surface of the coffee). Garnish with toasted coconut flakes."
